Installing this theme is pretty easy. After download you should have a fiera.zip (compressed file with all folders and files of this theme).

### Installation
You can use WordPress Admin Panel to install this theme or do it manually.

1. Go to **Appearance > Themes**

# Adapting existing content
---------------
If you already have menus and widgets on the website, you need to do this after finishing the theme activation process:

1. Go to **Appearance > Menus** and update theme locations
2. Go to **Appearance > Widgets** and add old widgets to new sidebars

If you already have uploaded images on the website, you should regenerate thumbnails. To do that you can install [Regenerate Thumbnails](http://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) plugin.

If you didn't use featured images you can install the [Easy Add Thumbnail](http://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-add-thumbnail/) plugin to dinamically set featured images for old published posts.
